## ENSTRAID: Transforming the Future of Mobility

ENSTRAID is an innovative student-led association at ENSTA Paris, focused on retrofitting thermal vehicles into fully electric ones. Our flagship project involves converting a classic Peugeot 205 into a 100% electric vehicle, demonstrating the potential of green energy solutions in the automotive sector. This initiative not only contributes to the ecological transition but also promotes practical engineering experience for students.

As the **Treasurer** of ENSTRAID during its founding, I oversaw the financial management and ensured that the project stayed within budget while securing necessary funding. We successfully raised **€10,000**, mainly from ENSTA alumni and IP Paris, which was crucial for moving the project forward.

Through collaboration with partners and fellow students, ENSTRAID exemplifies a hands-on approach to sustainability and technical expertise, actively contributing to reducing the environmental impact of older vehicles.
