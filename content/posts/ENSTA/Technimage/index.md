# Technimage - ENSTA Paris Audiovisual Association

**Technimage** is the audiovisual association of ENSTA Paris. Our mission is to capture and broadcast key moments of the school's student and associative life through various video formats:

- **Broadcasting the "Channels"**: The school's news channel.
- **Covering associative events**: Capturing video highlights from association activities.
- **Live productions**: Live streaming of key events.
- **Video production**: Creating clips for the Channel, associations, or the school's communications department.
- **Short film contests**: Participating in competitions such as "Le Rush," where we won the award for best screenplay at the 5th edition, a 36-hour short film competition.

### My Contribution

As an active member of **Technimage**, I had the opportunity to edit and produce several video clips, including:

- Videos for **BDE lists** and other associative events at ENSTA.
- Work for ENSTA Paris itself, such as:
  - The **racquet sports presentation video**: {{< youtube 4BOrO2d3ECI >}}

  - The promotion of **research internships** for second-year students: {{< youtube IWoqTgolCq4 >}}

My involvement with **Technimage** allowed me to develop skills in directing, editing, and video production, while actively contributing to promoting the associative and academic life of ENSTA Paris.
