# Vision Vendor: A Breakthrough in Secondhand Market Reselling

As the AI landscape continues to evolve, the **Gemini API Developer Competition by Google** has become a global stage for developers to showcase their innovations. From June 2024 to August 2024, this competition invited creative minds to harness the power of the **Google Gemini models** and push the boundaries of AI technology. With up to **$260,000 in prizes** up for grabs, it attracted a wide range of developers eager to build impactful solutions.

## The Vision Vendor Journey

My teammate, **Fabien Houang**, and I embraced this challenge to create **Vision Vendor**—an AI-powered application aimed at transforming the way users engage with the secondhand market. The app leverages **Google Gemini models** to deliver a seamless experience by integrating **camera functionalities** and **KPI generation** for **price comparison**. 

We were driven by a simple goal: to empower users by making online reselling more efficient and transparent. With the Vision Vendor app, anyone can snap a photo of an item and instantly receive pricing insights, providing the perfect tool for anyone involved in the growing secondhand economy.
