Let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, subscription fees are out of control. And that monthly charge for Spotify Premium? It adds up. For what? The \u0026ldquo;privilege\u0026rdquo; of downloading songs you don\u0026rsquo;t even own and listening without ads. I got tired of paying, so I decided to take matters into my own hands.\nWhat if I told you that you could have your entire Spotify library, automatically updated, available to stream anywhere, and even download for offline listening\u0026hellip; all for FREE? It sounds too good to be true, but I did it, and I\u0026rsquo;m about to show you how.\nThe Secret Recipe: Your Personal Music Cloud The magic lies in combining a few incredible open-source tools on a simple home server (a Raspberry Pi is perfect for this).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the master plan:\nAutomated Downloader: Use a script to \u0026ldquo;read\u0026rdquo; your Spotify playlists. Music Sync: Automatically download all the tracks from those playlists to your server. Personal Streaming Service: Run your own music server to stream your library to any device. Mobile App: Use a mobile app to connect to your server, stream, and download songs for the road. Step 1: The Downloader - spotDL The core of this operation is a brilliant tool called spotDL. This command-line utility takes a Spotify playlist URL, finds the songs on YouTube Music (or other sources), and downloads them as high-quality MP3 files, complete with all the metadata like album art, artist, and album name.\nInstallation is simple with pip:\npip install spotdl To download a whole playlist, you just run:\nspotdl download \u0026#39;YOUR_SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_URL\u0026#39; The script will do the rest, downloading the tracks into a nicely organized folder.\nStep 2: The Automation - cron Downloading your playlist once is great, but what about all the new songs you add? You don\u0026rsquo;t want to run the command manually every time. This is where cron, the built-in Linux task scheduler, comes in.\nWe can set up a cron job to run spotDL automatically every night. This way, any new songs you add to your Spotify playlist during the day will be waiting for you on your server the next morning.\nOpen your crontab editor:\ncrontab -e And add this line to run the sync every day at 3 AM:\n0 3 * * * /usr/bin/spotdl download \u0026#39;YOUR_SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_URL\u0026#39; --output /path/to/your/music Now your music library updates itself while you sleep!\nStep 3: The Streaming Server - Navidrome Now that you have a folder full of music, you need a way to listen to it. Enter Navidrome, a lightweight, modern, and open-source music server. It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly easy to set up, especially with Docker.\nNavidrome scans your music folder, organizes everything beautifully, and gives you a slick web interface that looks just like\u0026hellip; well, a professional streaming service!\nYou can run it with a simple docker-compose.yml file:\nversion: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; services: navidrome: image: deluan/navidrome:latest user: 1000:1000 # replace with your user and group ID ports: - \u0026#34;4533:4533\u0026#34; restart: unless-stopped environment: # All options are optional, see https://www.navidrome.org/docs/usage/configuration-options/ ND_SCANSCHEDULE: 1h ND_LOGLEVEL: info ND_SESSIONTIMEOUT: 24h ND_BASEURL: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; volumes: - \u0026#34;/path/to/navidrome/data:/data\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;/path/to/your/music:/music:ro\u0026#34; Once it\u0026rsquo;s running, you have your own personal Spotify, hosted at home.\nStep 4: The Mobile App - Freedom on the Go! This is the final piece of the puzzle. Navidrome is compatible with the popular Subsonic API. This means dozens of mobile apps can connect to your server.\nFor iOS, apps like play:Sub, substreamer, or Amperfy work great. For Android, you have even more choices.\nJust point the app to your server\u0026rsquo;s address, log in, and voilà! Your entire music library is in your pocket. The best part? All these apps allow you to cache or download songs directly to your phone for offline listening.\nA Note on Remote Access By default, this setup is available on your local network. But what about when you leave the house? You have two simple and secure options:\nDownload Your Music: Before you head out, use your mobile app to download your favorite playlists or albums. The music will be saved directly on your device, ready for offline playback anywhere. Use a VPN: For live streaming from anywhere, you can use a VPN (like WireGuard or Tailscale) to securely connect back to your home network. This makes your phone act as if it\u0026rsquo;s on your local Wi-Fi, giving you full access to your Navidrome server. You just recreated the best feature of Spotify Premium for free. So go ahead, cancel that subscription and take back control of your music!\n","date":"September 14, 2025","hero":"/posts/spotify-free/Spotify_Logo.png","permalink":"https://marcchen.github.io/posts/spotify-free/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"is-spotify-premium-robbing-you-blind\"\u003eIs Spotify Premium Robbing You Blind?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s be honest, subscription fees are out of control.

We left with way too many bungee cords on our bikes—first mistake. The second mistake became clear the next morning: painful saddle sores. Advice: wear cycling shorts for this kind of trip!\nWe also carried too much water. I had two 3L hydration packs and several bottles, making my load quite heavy, already burdened by a tent and other gear. In reality, since we passed through many villages, it was easy to ask locals for water, which also gave us a chance to connect with them.\nThe trip mainly took place on departmental roads between fields and villages, with strong winds that made the journey unpleasant.

With only buses to travel between locations, I frequently encountered situations at the Place Marguerite Pery bus station, just in front of Telecom Paris, where no ETA (estimated time of arrival) was available. To know when to leave my house, I had to check the bus schedule on my phone each time before heading out. This sparked the idea to create a system that could provide real-time bus arrival times, making my commute more predictable and efficient.\nThe project focused on developing an IoT system specifically for my local bus station, with the aim of offering live bus arrival information for better timing. The core challenge wasn’t API integration, as the RATP API is well-documented, but rather connecting the ESP32 microcontroller to the public Wi-Fi network in my student housing. The Wi-Fi had a portal login page, which made it tricky. I used Wireshark to capture the network traffic from my computer when connecting through the portal, replicating the same process on the ESP32, which successfully worked.\nDevelopment Overview The project entailed several components:\nAPI Integration: Initially, we simulated real-time data using the RATP API to retrieve bus arrival times, which could be replaced by sensor-based data from actual bus stations in the future. Data Processing: The collected data was processed to predict bus arrival times. A countdown mechanism helped reduce the frequency of API requests, optimizing power consumption. Key Contributions Power Optimization: A key improvement was the implementation of a countdown to manage API requests efficiently, reducing unnecessary power usage. Future Potential One future improvement would be to implement a schedule to manage power efficiency by automatically turning off the system during working hours when it is not needed. This would ensure that power is used only when the system is actively providing information.\nFor more details, you can follow the progress of our project:\nProject avaiable on Github ","date":"October 10, 2024","hero":"/posts/codelab/bus-countdown-timer/devboard.jpg","permalink":"https://marcchen.github.io/posts/codelab/bus-countdown-timer/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"bus-station-project-enhancing-public-transport-with-iot\"\u003eBus Station Project: Enhancing Public Transport with IoT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eBus Station Project\u003c/strong\u003e began as a personal solution to a common problem I faced while studying at Paris-Saclay.
