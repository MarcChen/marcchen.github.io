Over the years, I\u0026rsquo;ve experimented with various resources, and today I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share a few that have been instrumental in my journey. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re just starting out or looking to deepen your expertise, these tools and tips can help you master new skills more effectively.\nDiscovering VIM the Fun Way At first, the idea of using VIM seemed daunting. The interface was cluttered, and the commands felt like learning a new language. However, I discovered a resource that transformed this intimidating tool into an engaging playground:\nVim Adventures:\nThis game-like experience turns learning VIM into an interactive adventure. It’s a brilliant way to get comfortable with VIM commands while having fun. The progressive challenges help you build muscle memory and make the steep learning curve much more manageable. Additional Tip: Consider pairing Vim Adventures with a cheat sheet of basic commands. Print it out and keep it handy as you progress through the levels.\nDemystifying Regular Expressions Regular expressions (regex) are incredibly powerful for searching and manipulating text, but they can be intimidating at first glance. I remember feeling lost with all the symbols and syntax, until I found resources that broke it all down into simple, digestible parts.\nRegex Learn:\nThis guide provides clear explanations and examples, making it easier to understand the fundamentals of regular expressions.\nRegex101:\nBeyond just a guide, Regex101 offers a live testing environment. You can experiment with your regex patterns, see immediate feedback, and even learn from the detailed breakdowns of your expressions. This hands-on practice is invaluable for truly grasping the concepts.\nAdditional Tip: When practicing regex, start with simple patterns and gradually build complexity. Experimenting with real-world text samples can provide context and improve your understanding.\nEmbracing Practical Testing and Debugging Nothing beats hands-on practice when learning a new skill. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s debugging code or refining your regex patterns, practical testing is key. In addition to Regex101, here are a few more tips for effective testing and learning:\nUse Interactive Tools:\nPlatforms like CodePen or JSFiddle allow you to experiment with code snippets in real-time. These tools are especially useful for web developers looking to test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together.\nParticipate in Coding Challenges:\nWebsites like LeetCode or HackerRank offer coding challenges that push you to apply what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned. These platforms provide a community and a sense of competition that can motivate you to keep improving.\nJoin Online Communities:\nPlatforms like Stack Overflow or relevant subreddits (e.g., r/learnprogramming) can offer support and answer questions when you\u0026rsquo;re stuck. Sharing your journey with others can provide new insights and encouragement.\nBalancing Theory with Practice One common pitfall in learning is spending too much time on theory without practical application. Here are some strategies to strike the right balance:\nSet Clear Goals: Define what you want to achieve with each new tool or concept. Setting milestones can help you stay focused. Practice Regularly: Even short, daily practice sessions can make a huge difference over time. Consistency is key. Reflect on Your Progress: Keep a learning journal or blog (like this one!) to document your progress. Reflecting on what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned reinforces your understanding and highlights areas for improvement. Wrapping Up The journey to mastering new skills is a marathon, not a sprint. With the right tools and strategies, even the most challenging subjects become approachable and fun. From turning VIM into a game with Vim Adventures to unlocking the power of regular expressions with Regex101, each resource has played a crucial role in my learning process.\nRemember, the key is to stay curious, be patient with yourself, and never stop exploring new techniques.

We left with way too many bungee cords on our bikes—first mistake. The second mistake became clear the next morning: painful saddle sores. Advice: wear cycling shorts for this kind of trip!\nWe also carried too much water. I had two 3L hydration packs and several bottles, making my load quite heavy, already burdened by a tent and other gear. In reality, since we passed through many villages, it was easy to ask locals for water, which also gave us a chance to connect with them.\nThe trip mainly took place on departmental roads between fields and villages, with strong winds that made the journey unpleasant. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t particularly recommend this route, and unfortunately, I didn\u0026rsquo;t take any photos during this difficult journey \u0026hellip;\nEdition 2: Cabourg - Saint-Malo (500 km, 3000 m elevation gain) This second trip was much better organized. We had planned the entire route, and here\u0026rsquo;s an animation of the journey:\nThis trip was much more enjoyable, as I had the pleasure of discovering the D-Day beaches, a place I had never visited before, which helped me brush up on some history. This time, with the same amount of gear, we wore cycling shorts, and the kilometers passed easily. We only had one flat tire throughout the trip.\nHere are some photos:\nGallery Edition 3: Fontainebleau - Orléans (250 km along the Loire) For this shorter weekend trip, I switched from a mountain bike to a gravel bike. However, on the second day, I had four flat tires in a row, despite using puncture-resistant tires. I later discovered that I had been improperly installing the inner tube after each repair, which caused it to pinch and puncture again during inflation.\nHere are a few photos of my new setup, along with some beautiful views from the trip.\nGallery Your browser does not support the video tag.

With only buses to travel between locations, I frequently encountered situations at the Place Marguerite Pery bus station, just in front of Telecom Paris, where no ETA (estimated time of arrival) was available. To know when to leave my house, I had to check the bus schedule on my phone each time before heading out. This sparked the idea to create a system that could provide real-time bus arrival times, making my commute more predictable and efficient.\nThe project focused on developing an IoT system specifically for my local bus station, with the aim of offering live bus arrival information for better timing. The core challenge wasn’t API integration, as the RATP API is well-documented, but rather connecting the ESP32 microcontroller to the public Wi-Fi network in my student housing. The Wi-Fi had a portal login page, which made it tricky. I used Wireshark to capture the network traffic from my computer when connecting through the portal, replicating the same process on the ESP32, which successfully worked.\nDevelopment Overview The project entailed several components:\nAPI Integration: Initially, we simulated real-time data using the RATP API to retrieve bus arrival times, which could be replaced by sensor-based data from actual bus stations in the future. Data Processing: The collected data was processed to predict bus arrival times. A countdown mechanism helped reduce the frequency of API requests, optimizing power consumption. Key Contributions Power Optimization: A key improvement was the implementation of a countdown to manage API requests efficiently, reducing unnecessary power usage. Future Potential One future improvement would be to implement a schedule to manage power efficiency by automatically turning off the system during working hours when it is not needed. This would ensure that power is used only when the system is actively providing information.\nFor more details, you can follow the progress of our project:\nProject avaiable on Github ","date":"October 10, 2024","hero":"/posts/codelab/bus-countdown-timer/devboard.jpg","permalink":"https://marcchen.github.io/posts/codelab/bus-countdown-timer/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"bus-station-project-enhancing-public-transport-with-iot\"\u003eBus Station Project: Enhancing Public Transport with IoT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eBus Station Project\u003c/strong\u003e began as a personal solution to a common problem I faced while studying at Paris-Saclay.
