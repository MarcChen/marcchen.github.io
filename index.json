We left with way too many bungee cords on our bikes—first mistake. The second mistake became clear the next morning: painful saddle sores. Advice: wear cycling shorts for this kind of trip!\nWe also carried too much water. I had two 3L hydration packs and several bottles, making my load quite heavy, already burdened by a tent and other gear. In reality, since we passed through many villages, it was easy to ask locals for water, which also gave us a chance to connect with them.\nThe trip mainly took place on departmental roads between fields and villages, with strong winds that made the journey unpleasant. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t particularly recommend this route, and unfortunately, I didn\u0026rsquo;t take any photos during this difficult journey \u0026hellip;\nEdition 2: Cabourg - Saint-Malo (500 km, 3000 m elevation gain) This second trip was much better organized. We had planned the entire route, and here\u0026rsquo;s an animation of the journey:\nThis trip was much more enjoyable, as I had the pleasure of discovering the D-Day beaches, a place I had never visited before, which helped me brush up on some history. This time, with the same amount of gear, we wore cycling shorts, and the kilometers passed easily. We only had one flat tire throughout the trip.\nHere are some photos:\nGallery Edition 3: Fontainebleau - Orléans (250 km along the Loire) For this shorter weekend trip, I switched from a mountain bike to a gravel bike. However, on the second day, I had four flat tires in a row, despite using puncture-resistant tires. I later discovered that I had been improperly installing the inner tube after each repair, which caused it to pinch and puncture again during inflation.\nHere are a few photos of my new setup, along with some beautiful views from the trip.\nGallery Your browser does not support the video tag.

With only buses to travel between locations, I frequently encountered situations at the Place Marguerite Pery bus station, just in front of Telecom Paris, where no ETA (estimated time of arrival) was available. To know when to leave my house, I had to check the bus schedule on my phone each time before heading out. This sparked the idea to create a system that could provide real-time bus arrival times, making my commute more predictable and efficient.\nThe project focused on developing an IoT system specifically for my local bus station, with the aim of offering live bus arrival information for better timing. The core challenge wasn’t API integration, as the RATP API is well-documented, but rather connecting the ESP32 microcontroller to the public Wi-Fi network in my student housing. The Wi-Fi had a portal login page, which made it tricky. I used Wireshark to capture the network traffic from my computer when connecting through the portal, replicating the same process on the ESP32, which successfully worked.\nDevelopment Overview The project entailed several components:\nAPI Integration: Initially, we simulated real-time data using the RATP API to retrieve bus arrival times, which could be replaced by sensor-based data from actual bus stations in the future. Data Processing: The collected data was processed to predict bus arrival times. A countdown mechanism helped reduce the frequency of API requests, optimizing power consumption. Key Contributions Power Optimization: A key improvement was the implementation of a countdown to manage API requests efficiently, reducing unnecessary power usage. Future Potential One future improvement would be to implement a schedule to manage power efficiency by automatically turning off the system during working hours when it is not needed. This would ensure that power is used only when the system is actively providing information.\nFor more details, you can follow the progress of our project:\nProject avaiable on Github ","date":"October 10, 2024","hero":"/posts/bus-countdown-timer/devboard.jpg","permalink":"https://marcchen.github.io/posts/bus-countdown-timer/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"bus-station-project-enhancing-public-transport-with-iot\"\u003eBus Station Project: Enhancing Public Transport with IoT\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eBus Station Project\u003c/strong\u003e began as a personal solution to a common problem I faced while studying at Paris-Saclay.
