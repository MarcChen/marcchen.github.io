&lt;p>Learning new skills can be overwhelming, but with the right tools, the process becomes both fun and effective. Over time, I’ve embraced methods that mix interactive challenges with hands-on experiments. In this post, I share how mastering VIM, exploring regular expressions, and diving into my Notebook Lab have transformed my learning approach.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At first, the idea of using VIM was daunting. The learning curve felt steep until I discovered a resource that made it exciting:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notion2GoogleTask</title><link>https://marcchen.github.io/posts/codelab/notion2googletask/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 10:52:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcchen.github.io/posts/codelab/notion2googletask/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introducing-notion2googletasks-automate-your-task-management-across-platforms">Introducing Notion2GoogleTasks: Automate Your Task Management Across Platforms&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In today’s fast-paced world, managing your tasks across multiple tools can feel like a juggling act. That’s why I created &lt;strong>Notion2GoogleTasks&lt;/strong>—a powerful microservice that bridges the gap between Notion and Google Tasks, ensuring your task lists are always in sync and up-to-date, no matter which platform you’re using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine never having to worry about whether your completed tasks in Notion are reflected in Google Tasks, or vice versa. With Notion2GoogleTasks, you get &lt;strong>two-way synchronization&lt;/strong> that works on your schedule—whether you’re using GitHub Actions, cron jobs, or any other runner—so you can focus on what matters most: getting things done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bike 600km roadtrip</title><link>https://marcchen.github.io/posts/bike/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 22:33:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcchen.github.io/posts/bike/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="my-cycling-adventures-a-journey-of-lessons-and-exploration">My Cycling Adventures: A Journey of Lessons and Exploration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The goal of this post is to share my cycling road trip experiences, the challenges I encountered, and the lessons learned along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="edition-1-paris---cabourg">Edition 1: Paris - Cabourg&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My first trip, Paris - Cabourg (240 km in 2 days), was done with no preparation. We left with way too many bungee cords on our bikes—first mistake. The second mistake became clear the next morning: painful saddle sores. Advice: wear cycling shorts for this kind of trip!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ENSTRAID</title><link>https://marcchen.github.io/posts/ensta/enstraid/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 22:32:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcchen.github.io/posts/ensta/enstraid/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="enstraid-transforming-the-future-of-mobility">ENSTRAID: Transforming the Future of Mobility&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ENSTRAID is an innovative student-led association at ENSTA Paris, focused on retrofitting thermal vehicles into fully electric ones. Our flagship project involves converting a classic Peugeot 205 into a 100% electric vehicle, demonstrating the potential of green energy solutions in the automotive sector. This initiative not only contributes to the ecological transition but also promotes practical engineering experience for students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the &lt;strong>Treasurer&lt;/strong> of ENSTRAID during its founding, I oversaw the financial management and ensured that the project stayed within budget while securing necessary funding. We successfully raised &lt;strong>€10,000&lt;/strong>, mainly from ENSTA alumni and IP Paris, which was crucial for moving the project forward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Technimage</title><link>https://marcchen.github.io/posts/ensta/technimage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 22:31:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcchen.github.io/posts/ensta/technimage/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="technimage---ensta-paris-audiovisual-association">Technimage - ENSTA Paris Audiovisual Association&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Bus Station Project&lt;/strong> began as a personal solution to a common problem I faced while studying at Paris-Saclay. With only buses to travel between locations, I frequently encountered situations at the Place Marguerite Pery bus station, just in front of Telecom Paris, where no ETA (estimated time of arrival) was available. To know when to leave my house, I had to check the bus schedule on my phone each time before heading out. This sparked the idea to create a system that could provide real-time bus arrival times, making my commute more predictable and efficient.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gemini Developper Contest</title><link>https://marcchen.github.io/posts/codelab/gemini-developper-contest/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://marcchen.github.io/posts/codelab/gemini-developper-contest/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="vision-vendor-a-breakthrough-in-secondhand-market-reselling">Vision Vendor: A Breakthrough in Secondhand Market Reselling&lt;/h1>
