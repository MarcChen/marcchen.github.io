&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Bus Station Project&lt;/strong> began as a personal solution to a common problem I faced while studying at Paris-Saclay. With only buses to travel between locations, I frequently encountered situations at the Place Marguerite Pery bus station, just in front of Telecom Paris, where no ETA (estimated time of arrival) was available. To know when to leave my house, I had to check the bus schedule on my phone each time before heading out. This sparked the idea to create a system that could provide real-time bus arrival times, making my commute more predictable and efficient.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
