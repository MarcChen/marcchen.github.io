&lt;p&gt;ENSTRAID is an innovative student-led association at ENSTA Paris, focused on retrofitting thermal vehicles into fully electric ones. Our flagship project involves converting a classic Peugeot 205 into a 100% electric vehicle, demonstrating the potential of green energy solutions in the automotive sector. This initiative not only contributes to the ecological transition but also promotes practical engineering experience for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;strong&gt;Treasurer&lt;/strong&gt; of ENSTRAID during its founding, I oversaw the financial management and ensured that the project stayed within budget while securing necessary funding. We successfully raised &lt;strong&gt;â‚¬10,000&lt;/strong&gt;, mainly from ENSTA alumni and IP Paris, which was crucial for moving the project forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
